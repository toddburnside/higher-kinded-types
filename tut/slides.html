<h1>Higher Kinded Types?<br>Why Should I Care?</h1>

Today I'm going to talk about what Higher Kinded Types are.

At first glance, HKTs seem a bit esoteric, and of interest only to advanced practioners of the dark arts.
But, it turns out they solve some programming issues quite nicely. So, we're going to build up an example
where a problem manifests itself, then see how HKTs solve the problem.

# Maybe?

A data type similar to Scala's Option type.

```tut:silent
sealed trait Maybe[+A]
case class Yes[A](a: A) extends Maybe[A]
case object No extends Maybe[Nothing]
```
???
Maybe is Haskell's equivalent for Option. Or, vice versa.

---

#Maybe?

```tut:silent
object M {
  sealed trait Maybe[+A] {
    def map[B](f: A => B): Maybe[B] = this match {
      case Yes(a) => Yes(f(a))
      case No => No: Maybe[B]
    }

    def fproduct[B](f: A => B): Maybe[(A, B)] =
      map(a => (a, f(a)))

    def getOrElse[AA >: A](aa: AA): AA = this match {
      case Yes(a) => a
      case No => aa
    }
  }

  case class Yes[A](a: A) extends Maybe[A]
  case object No extends Maybe[Nothing]
}
```

???
Let's add a couple methods...
The enclosing object is just to satisfy the REPL. The slideshow uses tut to ensure that the code is correct...
---
#Yes?

```tut
import M._

val y = Yes(4)
y.map(_ + 2)
y.fproduct(_ * 3)
y.getOrElse(7)
```
???
Now we can use it as expected.

---
#No

```tut
val n: Maybe[String] = No
n.map(_.length)
n.fproduct(_ + "!")
n.getOrElse("else")
```

---
#Cons List

```tut:silent
object L {
  sealed trait CList[+A] {
    def map[B](f: A => B): CList[B] = this match {
      case Nil => Nil
      case Cons(head, tail) => Cons(f(head), tail.map(f))
    }

    def fproduct[B](f: A => B): CList[(A, B)] =
      map(a => (a, f(a)))
  }

  case object Nil extends CList[Nothing]
  case class Cons[A](head: A, tail: CList[A]) extends CList[A]
}
```
???
A List superficially similar to List in the Scala std library.

Yes, I know this is a naive implementation of map and is not
stack safe, but it's simple.
---
#Cons List

```tut
import L._

val l = Cons("foo", Cons("foobar", Cons("baz", Nil)))
l.map(_ + "!")

l.fproduct(_.length)

val n: CList[String] = Nil
n.map(_.length)
```
---
#Maybe

```scala
def map[B](f: A => B): Maybe[B] = this match {
  case Yes(a) => Yes(f(a))
  case No => No: Maybe[B]
}

def fproduct[B](f: A => B): Maybe[(A, B)] =
  map(a => (a, f(a)))
```
#CList
```scala
def map[B](f: A => B): CList[B] = this match {
  case Nil => Nil
  case Cons(head, tail) => Cons(f(head), tail.map(f))
}

def fproduct[B](f: A => B): CList[(A, B)] =
  map(a => (a, f(a)))
```
???
After implementing these, we notice some similarities...Both have
a map method, and an fproduct defined in terms of map.

As good programmers, we want to abstract over this.
As good OO programmers, we know exactly what to do.
---
#Inheritance

```tut:silent:reset
trait Functor[+A] {
  def map[B](f: A => B): Functor[B]

  def fproduct[B](f: A => B) = map(a => (a, f(a)))
}
```
???
We've been reading a bit about functional programming, and
recognize this as something called a Functor, so...
--

```tut:silent
object M {
  sealed trait Maybe[+A] extends Functor[A] {
    def map[B](f: A => B) = this match {
      case No => No
      case Yes(a) => Yes(f(a))
    }

    def getOrElse[AA >: A](aa: AA): AA = this match {
      case Yes(a) => a
      case No => aa
    }
  }

  case object No extends Maybe[Nothing]
  case class Yes[A](a: A) extends Maybe[A]
}
```
???
Here's our Maybe implementation.

#Problem 1: It's invasive.

We couldn't use our existing implementation, we had
to extend our Funtor trait.

---
#Using It

```tut
import M._
val m = Yes("yes")

m.map(_ + "?")
```
???
But, it seems to work fine.
--
```tut:fail
m.map(_ + "?").getOrElse("no")
```
???
Oops. What happened.
--
```tut
m.map(_ + "?")
```
???
#Problem 2: Return type is Functor

What we want is return type polymorphism - if we call it on a
Maybe, we want a Maybe back. Likewise for a CList.

Mention Microsoft Linq: IEnumerable. Works OK for collection types,
but you still need to call ToList() or ToArray() or whatever.
---
#Values

```tut:silent
val x = 2
val zz = "top"
```
???
So, let's talk a bit about Values, Types and Kinds

x and zz are values.
--
```tut:silent
val f = (i: Int) => i * 7
```
???
Functions are "first class" in Scala, so they are values, too.
--
```tut:silent
def doStuff(i: Int, s: String, f: Int => Int) = {
  f(i) + s.length
}
```
```tut
doStuff(x, zz, f)
```
???
Values are things that you can assign to variables and pass around to
functions, etc.
--
```tut:silent
case class InCase(i: Int, s: String)
val c = InCase(1, "this")
```
???
instances of classes are values, too.
--
```tut:silent
var bah = 13
```
???
As are vars.
--
```tut:silent
def meth(i: Int): Int = {i * 7}
```
???
__meth__ is NOT a value. It is a method, and methods are different that functions.
Methods can be converted to functions, and often that is done transparently,
but in some cases you need to explicitly convert them.
---
#Types
```
scala> :t x
Int

scala>:t zz
String

scala>:t f
Int => Int

scala>:t c
InCase
```
???
So, what about types?

We can use __:t__ in the REPL to inspect the type of a value.

Types are a way of categorizing values. In strongly typed languages,
we use them to tell the compiler what "types" of values are acceptable
at various places in our code.

Notice that __f__ has a Type which transforms one Type into another Type
--
```
scala>:t doStuff _
(Int, String, Int => Int) => Int
```
???
doStuff, once converted to a function (note the trailing underscore),
is a higher ordered function.
It is a function that takes another function as an argument.
---
#Types
```
val o = Some(1)

scala>:t o
Some[Int]
```
???
Sometimes the type of something isn't what we want/expect.
In this case, we probably wanted an Option[Int], not a Some[Int].

While this will often be automagically widened when and Option
is expected, it can cause problems with type inference.
--
```
val o: Option[Int] = Some(1)

scala>:t o
Option[Int]
```
???
This can be remedied with explicit type ascription.
--
```scala
val o = 1.some

scala>:t o
Option[Int]
```
???
But libraries like Cats and Scalaz provide helpful syntax which
is terser.
---
#Types
```tut:silent
val mult = (x: Int, y: Int) => x * y
```
```
scala>:t mult
(Int, Int) => Int
```
???
Functions with several parameters convert multiple types into
another type.
--
```tut
val times5 = mult(_: Int, 5)
times5(3)
```
```
scala>:t times5
Int => Int
```
???
We can partially apply a function.
--
```tut:silent
def multParam(i: Int)(s: String) = i + s.length
```
```
scala>:t multParam _
Int => (String => Int)
```
???
Calling multParam with only the integer returns another
function that takes a string and returns and integer.

So, types are a way of categorizing values.

---
#Kinds

```
scala>:k Int
Int's kind is A

scala>:k String
String's kind is A
```
???
Moving on to Kinds.

Kinds are a property of Types. In the REPL, we can use __:k__ to
inspect the Kind for a Type.

Kinds are a way of categorizing Types. Or,
Kinds are to Types as Types are to Values.
--
```
scala>:k Option[Int]
Option[Int]'s kind is A
```
???
Kind A indicates Types for we can create a Value.
---
#Kinds
```
scala>:k Option
Option's kind is F[+A]

scala>:k List
List's kind is F[+A]

scala>:k Either
Either's kind is F[+A1, +A2]
```
???
These are called Type Constructors, or Higher Kinded Types.  You
give them a type (or 2 in the case of Either), and you get another
type back.

Like a function that takes another function as a parameter in
order to give you a value is
a higher ordered function. A Type that takes one or more Types to give
you a Type is a Higher Kinded Type.

It is the ability to abstract over these Higher Kinded Types that
provides a solution to our problem.

---
#HKT Approach

<!-- This trait is copied and pasted several times for when alternate
instances for Either are required. If it is changed here, make
sure to change it everywhere. -->
```tut:reset:silent
trait Functor[F[_]] {
  def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
  def fproduct[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[(A, B)]
    = map(fa)(a => (a, f(a)))
}
```
???
A trait with an abstract map() method and fproduct() defined in terms
of map().

Note the underscore in F[_]. It is saying that Functor is parameterized
on a Type Constructor that takes one Type.

Some of you may recognize this as a typeclass. The word typeclass
comes from Haskell, but is perhaps a poor choice of naming for
Scala, since typeclasses have nothing to do with OO classes
or the 'class' keyword in Scala.

--
```
scala>:k Functor
Functor's kind is X[F[A]]
```
???
So, what is the kind of Functor?

---
#Option

```tut:silent
implicit val optionFunctor = new Functor[Option] {
    def map[A, B](fa: Option[A])(f: A => B): Option[B] =
      fa.map(f)
}
```
???
How do we extend a trait that is parameterized by a Type Constructor?

The "trick" is that we don't extend it. We don't use inheritance, we
create an implicit, anonymous instance of it for a particular type
constructor?

Since we're not using inheritance, anymore, we'll just go straight to
the standard library types.
--
```tut:silent
def double[F[_]](f: F[Int])(implicit ev: Functor[F]): F[Int] =
  ev.map(f)(_ * 2)
```
???
We can create a method that takes a Functor. Note, that we simply
parameterize the method on __any__ one parameter type constructor,
but the __f__ parameter is constrained to F[Int] here, and we
are requiring that the compiler be able to find proof that F has
a Functor instance via the implicit parameter.

ev could be named anything, but ev is common => evidence
---
#Option
```tut
val s: Option[Int] = Some(3)
val n: Option[Int] = None

double(s)
double(n)
```
???
Note that the return type is Option, not Functor
--
```tut
double(s).getOrElse(8)
double(n).getOrElse(8)
```
---
#Type Constraint
```tut:silent
def length[F[_]: Functor](f: F[String]): F[Int] =
  implicitly[Functor[F]].map(f)(_.length)
```
???
We can also use a type constraint to specify that F must have a
Functor instance, which is more concise, but if we want to use
it we need to summon the instance via __implicitly__
--
```tut
val ss: Option[String] = Some("string")

length(ss)
```
---
# Either
```tut:silent
val r: Either[String, Int] = Right(3)
val l: Either[String, Int] = Left("Oops")
```
???
But, what about Either? It seems reasonable to want to be able
to create a Functor for Either, especially since Either is now
right biased in Scala 2.12. But, Either takes 2 type parameters, and Functor
only works for types that take one type parameter.
--
```tut:silent
type ES[A] = Either[String, A]
```
???
Remember how we partially applied the parameters to a function above?
Well, we can do the same thing for types.
--
```
scala>k: ES
ES's kind is F[A]
```
???
Which is exactly the kind we need!
--
```tut:silent
implicit val esFunctor = new Functor[ES] {
  def map[A, B](fa: ES[A])(f: A => B) =
    fa.map(f)
}
```
```tut
double(r)
double(l)
```
???
So, we can create a Functor for it.

This works for any Either whose left is a String.

But, what if I want a Functor for Either[Throwable, Int]? Do I
need to create type aliases and Functor instances for every
type I want on the Left?

---
#Either
<!-- CopyPasta from above - keep them all in sych. -->
```tut:reset:invisible
trait Functor[F[_]] {
  def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
  def fproduct[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[(A, B)]
    = map(fa)(a => (a, f(a)))
}

def double[F[_]](f: F[Int])(implicit ev: Functor[F]): F[Int] =
  ev.map(f)(_ * 2)

val r: Either[String, Int] = Right(3)
val l: Either[String, Int] = Left("Oops")
```
```tut:silent
implicit def eitherFunctor[Z] =
  new Functor[({type E[X] = Either[Z, X]})#E] {
    def map[A, B](fa: Either[Z, A])(f: A => B) = fa.map(f)
  }
```
???
No, we can create an anonymous, partially applied type with a type lambda.

Fortunately, there ii has simple, terse syntax.

Not!
--
```scala
{type E[X] = Either[Z, X]})#E
```

???
Notice how we needed to make it an implicit def, because val's
can't take type parameters.

--
```tut:silent
val rt: Either[Throwable, Int] = Right(7)
var lt: Either[Throwable, Int] = Left(new Throwable("doh!"))
```
```tut
double(rt)
double(lt)
double(r)
double(l)
```
???
But it does work.
---
#Either
<!-- CopyPasta from above - keep them all in sych. -->
```tut:reset:invisible
trait Functor[F[_]] {
  def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
  def fproduct[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[(A, B)]
    = map(fa)(a => (a, f(a)))
}

def double[F[_]](f: F[Int])(implicit ev: Functor[F]): F[Int] =
  ev.map(f)(_ * 2)

val r: Either[String, Int] = Right(3)
val l: Either[String, Int] = Left("Oops")
val rt: Either[Throwable, Int] = Right(7)
var lt: Either[Throwable, Int] = Left(new Throwable("doh!"))
```

```tut:silent
implicit def eitherFunctor[Z]: Functor[Either[Z, ?]] =
  new Functor[Either[Z, ?]] {
    def map[A, B](fa: Either[Z, A])(f: A => B) = fa.map(f)
  }
```
???
There is a compiler plugin by Erik Osheim, called Kind Projector,
that provides a much simpler syntax for anonymous partially
applied types.
--
```tut
double(rt)
double(lt)
double(r)
double(l)
```
---
#Awkwardness

```tut:invisible
implicit val optionFunctor = new Functor[Option] {
    def map[A, B](fa: Option[A])(f: A => B): Option[B] =
      fa.map(f)
}
```

```tut
val someString: Option[String] = Some("string")

implicitly[Functor[Option]].map(someString)(_ + "?")
```

##vs

```tut
someString.map(_ + "?")
```
???
You may have noticed one drawback to the HKT approach compared to
inheritance - using it requires calling the method on the functor
instance versus calling it directly on the object.

Notice it does return the correct type, though.
---
#Return to Grace

```tut:reset:silent
object F {
  trait Functor[F[_]] {
    def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
    def fproduct[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[(A, B)]
      = map(fa)(a => (a, f(a)))
  }

  object Functor {
    def apply[F[_]](implicit ev: Functor[F]): Functor[F] = ev
  }

  implicit class
  FunctorOps[F[_], A](fa: F[A])(implicit ev: Functor[F]) {
    def map[B](f: A => B) = ev.map(fa)(f)
    def fproduct[B](f: A => B) = ev.fproduct(fa)(f)
  }
}

import F._
```
???
There are ways to fix that.

There are other ways to encode this.

Note that the __Ops__ class can also provide symbolic operators.
---
#Using It
```tut:silent
implicit val optionFunctor: Functor[Option] =
  new Functor[Option] {
      def map[A, B](fa: Option[A])(f: A => B): Option[B] =
        fa.map(f)
  }
```
???
Create our instance.

Note that it is a good idea to explicitly state the type of your
value. This prevents the compiler from inferring some odd types.
--
```tut
val someString: Option[String] = Some("string")

someString.fproduct(_ + "?")
```
???
Now we can call fproduct directly on an option
--
```tut
Functor[Option].map(someString)(_ + "!")
```

???
But what about map? Since option already has a map method, it will
be used preferentially by the compiler.

If we really need to call the Functor instance of map, we can make
use of the apply instance on the companion object.

All this requires a lot of boilerplate. Another compiler plugin,
Simulacrum by Michael Pilquist reduces the boilerplate.
